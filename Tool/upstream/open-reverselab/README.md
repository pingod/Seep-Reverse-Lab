## What is ReverseLab

ReverseLab is an opinionated, runnable attack-knowledge base for reverse engineers, security researchers, CTF players, and AI Agents. Every article is structured as **`Scenario → Input signal → Method → Attack chain → MCP tool mapping`**, so a human or an Agent can pick up at any entry signal and walk the chain to evidence.

- **5 boards** spanning web, mobile, Windows, and cross-domain reverse work.
- **180+ articles** organized by attack surface, not by tooling.
- **100+ MCP tools** exposed through `reverse_lab_tools` — curl, frida, ghidra, rizin, yara, triage, kb_router, … all callable from Claude Code, Codex, or any MCP-aware Agent.
- **Directory-as-convention**: every artifact has a fixed home (`samples/`, `exports/`, `patches/`, `kb/`, `reports/`). Drop-in a sample, follow the chain, ship the report.

The lab is built to be run, not browsed. If a step can't be executed, it doesn't belong in the KB.

## Who is this for

| You are … | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| A **CTF player** stuck on a web/Android/PE challenge | Browse the [CTF Website](kb/ctf-website/README.md), [APK Reverse](kb/apk-reverse/README.md), or [PE Reverse](kb/pe-reverse/README.md) board |
| A **security researcher** triaging a sample | [Quick start](#quick-start) → `boards/<board>/AI-USAGE.md` → `sample_full_workup` MCP tool |
| A **reverse engineer** who wants a workspace, not a tutorial | [Repository layout](#repository-layout) — clone and start |

## Quick start

Pick the path that matches your role, not your platform — the platform differences are below the role split.

### For humans

**Windows (recommended for first run)** — double-click `START_HERE.bat` (or `START_HERE.cmd`) in the repo root. It checks Python, `uv`, Git, the `reverse_lab_tools` MCP server, runs real MCP smoke calls, and writes `reports/misc/first-run-report.json` plus `reports/misc/mcp-smoke-report.json`.

**macOS / Linux** — run `./START_HERE.sh` from the repo root. It does the same first-run checks using POSIX shell wrappers under `tools/bin/`. Windows-only GUI/PE tools are skipped or reported as such.

<details>
<summary><b>Per-board install (after first-run passes)</b></summary>

```powershell
# Pick the boards you actually need — the lab is modular.
.\scripts\misc\bootstrap.ps1                # core script wrappers (no downloads)
.\scripts\misc\install_tools.ps1 -CTF       # Web tools (sqlmap, nuclei, ffuf, jwt_tool, …)
.\scripts\misc\install_tools.ps1 -Android   # APK tools (apktool, jadx, frida, uber-apk-signer, …)
.\scripts\misc\install_tools.ps1 -Windows   # PE tools (cutter, pe-bear, procmon, …)
.\scripts\misc\install_tools.ps1 -Common    # Ghidra + Maven
```

macOS / Linux equivalent:

```sh
./scripts/misc/bootstrap.sh
export PATH="$PWD/tools/bin:$PWD/tools/ctf-website/bin:$PATH"
python scripts/misc/ai_toolcheck.py --board misc    # verify the fresh-clone core
```

Install only the boards you need. Don't dump the full toolchain if you're only doing web CTF.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windows Defender / antivirus note</b></summary>

After installing CTF / ExploitDB tools, Windows Defender may flag exploit samples or payload documentation — e.g. `tools/ctf-website/exploitdb`, `kb/ctf-website/techniques/24-database/03-nosql-injection.md`, `docs/llms-full.txt`. These contain security test payloads, webshells, shellcode, or ExploitDB samples and are **expected components**.

We recommend **minimal path exclusions** rather than excluding the entire repo:

```powershell
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "D:\open-reverselab\tools\ctf-website\exploitdb"
```

If individual documents are flagged, handle them case-by-case.

</details>

### For AI Agents

1. Clone into a dedicated local directory, e.g. `<workspace>/open-reverselab`.
2. **Claude Code**: `cd <workspace>/open-reverselab`, then start your session.
3. **Codex APP**: Open the existing `open-reverselab` folder directly (no re-clone needed).
4. Automated AI install: send the contents of [`templates/prompts/ai-install.en.md`](templates/prompts/ai-install.en.md) to your Agent.
5. Create a task: `python scripts/misc/new_task.py --board ctf-website --name <name>`.
6. Verify real MCP invocation whenever switching machines or updating configs:
   ```sh
   uv run --project tools/skills/mcp/ReverseLabToolsMCP \
     python scripts/misc/mcp_smoke_check.py --write-report
   ```

**Context chain** — Agents load context through this sequence:

```
CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md → AI-USAGE.md → boards/<board>/AI-USAGE.md
```

Use [codex-session-patcher](https://github.com/ryfineZ/codex-session-patcher) for one-click configuration of project-level `.codex/` and MCP servers.

<details>
<summary><b>Environment snapshot protocol (host-level, shared across projects)</b></summary>

When first opening this project with an AI Agent, it inspects your local environment (OS, toolchains, reverse-engineering libraries, devices, sanitized env vars, network, workspace) following the protocol in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), and caches a snapshot at `~/.open-reverselab/env/env.md` (`%USERPROFILE%\.open-reverselab\env\env.md` on Windows).

This file is **host-level** and **shared across sessions**: subsequent sessions read it directly without re-probing, unless 7 days have passed or the protocol version has bumped. It remains local and is never committed. Sensitive variables are redacted (keys marked "SET", proxies stripped of credentials).

</details>

### Post-install verification

```sh
python scripts/misc/lab_healthcheck.py
python scripts/misc/ai_toolcheck.py --board misc
python scripts/misc/public_release_check.py
```

`--board misc` checks the fresh-clone core Agent scripts and lightweight tools. Run full `python scripts/misc/ai_toolcheck.py` only after installing Android / Windows / CTF boards.

## Repository layout

The repository uses **directory-as-convention**. Put artifacts where they belong and the tooling finds them automatically.

```
samples/      Original samples + _quarantine/ + unpacked/   — never modified
exports/      Tool outputs (triage / IOC / YARA / Sigma / Procmon / Ghidra summaries)
patches/      Patch artifacts (originals are never modified)
notes/        Analysis notes
reports/      Final reports
scripts/      Automation scripts
projects/     Ghidra project files
templates/    Note / report / rule templates · AI install prompts
kb/           Reusable attack knowledge base — see "Knowledge at a glance"
tools/        Toolchain (binaries, wrappers, registry, MCP)
cases/        Lightweight index — no large file copies
```

> Don't commit large samples, full PCAPs, or memory dumps. Index them in `cases/` and link to a private store.
